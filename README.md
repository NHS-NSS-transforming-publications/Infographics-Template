  * The Template.RMD is the main RMarkdown file that we are interested in.  When run/knit in RMarkdown this file
    will create the final HTML infographics output file named Template.html.
  * The README.md is simply this instruction file and can be ignored.
  * The Template_using_ggpubr.R is an alternative way to create basic infographics in an easier to use way using only R without RMarkdown.
  * The blue_pill_icon.PNG file is an image file that Template.RMD references and shows in the HTML output.  This image file is used to represent any image file that is referenced from an external source instead of being generated by R itself.

## Run/Knit the Template File
